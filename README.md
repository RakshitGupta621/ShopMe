ShopMe is a shopping site for shopping items. It has add to cart and remove from cart functionalities and generates the grand total.

Shop Me is a shopping cart React project
•	Firstly, there is a Buy Page which has different items to buy.
•	The photos of the items are taken from the Pexels API.
•	Faker API is used to generate fake prices and item names.
•	There is Add to cart option which adds the item to the cart.
•	It makes sure that an item is not repeated in the cart by generating a warning using React Toastify Library.
•	We can also remove the item from the cart.
•	We finally get the grand total of all the items in our cart.
•	On clicking ‘Pay Here’ it resets the whole cart and generates a toast that item is purchased.
